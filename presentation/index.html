            <h4>What is AR?</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Augmented reality (AR)</strong> is an interactive
              experience of a real-world environment where the objects that
              reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated
              perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory
              modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory and
              olfactory.

              AR can be defined as a system that fulfills three basic features:
              <li fragment grow>a combination of real and virtual worlds</li>
              <li fragment>real-time interaction</li>
              <li fragment>
                and accurate 3D registration of virtual and real objects
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>AR vs VR</h4>
            <!-- <p>
              In Virtual Reality (VR), the users' perception of reality is
              completely based on virtual information. In Augmented Reality (AR)
              the user is provided with additional computer generated
              information that enhances their perception of reality. For
              example, in architecture, VR can be used to create a walk-through
              simulation of the inside of a new building; and AR can be used to
              show a building's structures and systems super-imposed on a
              real-life view.
            </p>
            <p>
              Augmented Reality (AR) differs from Virtual Reality (VR) in the
              sense that in AR part of the surrounding environment is actually
              'real' and just adding layers of virtual objects to the real
              environment. On the other hand, in VR the surrounding environment
              is completely virtual. A demonstration of how AR layers objects
              onto the real world can be seen with augmented reality games.

            <h4>What is VR?</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Virtual reality (VR)</strong> is a simulated experience
              that can be similar to or completely different from the real
              world. Applications of virtual reality can include entertainment
              (i.e. video games) and educational purposes (i.e. medical or
              military training).

              Currently standard virtual reality systems use either virtual
              reality headsets or multi-projected environments to generate
              realistic images, sounds and other sensations that simulate a
              user's physical presence in a virtual environment.

            <h4>Using of VR</h4>
            <p>
              Virtual reality is most commonly used in entertainment
              applications such as video games and 3D cinema. Consumer virtual
              reality headsets were first released by video game companies in
              the early-mid 1990s. Beginning in the 2010s, next-generation
              commercial tethered headsets were released by Oculus (Rift), HTC
              (Vive) and Sony (PlayStation VR), setting off a new wave of
              application development. 3D cinema has been used for sporting
              events, pornography, fine art, music videos and short films. Since
              2015, roller coasters and theme parks have incorporated virtual
              reality to match visual effects with haptic feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Augmented/Mixed/Virtual Reality (AR/MR/VR) combo has enjoyed
              frenetic growth since 2016, coming from a marginal market value of
              bit more than $6 Billion to one that might reach the $210 Billion
              in sales (including hardware) by 2022. Of all, Augmented Reality
              is the one experiencing steady growth.

              VR can simulate real workspaces for workplace occupational safety
              and health purposes, educational purposes, and training purposes.
              It can be used to provide learners with a virtual environment
              where they can develop their skills without the real-world
              consequences of failing. It has been used and studied in primary
              education, anatomy teaching, military, astronaut training, flight
              simulators, miner training, architectural design, driver training
              and bridge inspection.

          <h4>
            Becoming JavaScript-Augmented
          </h4>
          <p>
            Before starting, I would suggest to have a look at the several AR
            platforms and standards. The same technical constraints affecting
            the industry are also reflected in the AR world. For example, there
            are several platforms, one for each Big Tech (Google = ARCode, Apple
            = ARKit, MS = ChakraCore, Facebook = AR Studio, React 360, Mozilla =
            aframe). After having a quick look at the options, starting fully
            JavaScript’ed Augmented Reality projects is relatively easy. You can
            begin by taking any web/app dev framework like Cordova, Ionic, React
            Native or Vue Native to embed the AR framework of your choice — and
            deploy 3D assets on top of the real world.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>If what you want is to deploy on the web using mostly marker-based AR, you could use GitHub repos like AR.js (free), argon.js (free but limited) or awe.js (paid PaaS but with an old GitHub repository still available). There are a few tailored ones that are harder for the novice, many of them focused on things like facial/head recognition (such as tracking.js and headtrackr).</p>

          <h4>AR js</h4>
          <p>AR.js is a lightweight library for Augmented Reality on the Web, coming with features like Image Tracking, Location based AR and Marker tracking.</p>
          <p>To boil it down, it’s essentially a Javascript framework acting as a port of ARToolkit, while leveraging other packages like a-frame and three.js. The goal being augmented reality features directly on web browsers without sacrificing performance. As far as compatibility goes, it works on any browser capable of WebGL + WebRTC.</p>
